# AI Usage Summary

## Overview
For this project, I used ChatGPT as a development partner to help create a complete PC Help Desk Support Solution. AI assisted with planning, documentation, troubleshooting content, explanations, and overall project organization.

## How AI Was Used
AI helped with the following tasks:
- Explaining each project requirement step-by-step  
- Guiding the creation of the repository inside Visual Studio Code  
- Generating all required documentation templates  
- Writing the troubleshooting guide  
- Creating the user communication response  
- Writing the knowledge base article  
- Creating a basic PowerShell diagnostic script  
- Helping structure the README file  
- Providing step-by-step instructions whenever I was confused  
- Helping me understand how to commit and push changes to GitHub  

## Example Prompts Used
Some of the prompts I used during development included:
- “I don’t understand anything.”  
- “Walk me through this from the beginning.”  
- “What do I put in the repository?”  
- “What’s next?”  
- “Push it.”  
- “Help me create the documentation.”  

## What AI Generated
AI generated:
- Documentation content (troubleshooting guide, communication message, knowledge base article)  
- The basic diagnostic script  
- The overall structure and layout of the project  
- Clear instructions for repository setup and file organization  
- Explanations of GitHub, VS Code, and workflow steps  

## What I Edited or Customized
I organized the repository, placed the files in the correct folders, renamed items as needed, and adjusted the documentation to fit the assignment requirements.

## How AI Improved My Workflow
AI made the project easier to understand and complete by:
- Breaking down tasks into simple steps  
- Reducing confusion during setup  
- Quickly generating documentation  
- Helping me stay organized  
- Explaining technical steps in a clear, understandable way
