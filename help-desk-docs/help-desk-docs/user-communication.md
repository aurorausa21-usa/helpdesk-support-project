**Subject:** Update on Your Wi-Fi Connectivity Issue

hi [user],

i’m following up regarding the wi-fi issue you reported earlier today.

the problem was caused by a network adapter configuration error. i reset the adapter and verified your connection. your device is now successfully connected to the internet.

please let me know if the issue returns or if you need anything else.

thanks,  
help desk support
